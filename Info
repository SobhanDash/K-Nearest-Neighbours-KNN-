KNN essentially used for grouping of data. 

KNN works for looking the K closest points to the given data point which is to be classified into a group 
and pick the class that occurs most to be the predicted value(most no. of times). 

This is why this algorithm typically works best when we can identify clusters of points in our data set.

K needs to take odd no. of data points so there is no tie between them and a bit more accurate model can be made.
